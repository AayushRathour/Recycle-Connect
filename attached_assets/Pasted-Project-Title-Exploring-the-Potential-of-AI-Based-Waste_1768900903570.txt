Project Title

Exploring the Potential of AI-Based Waste Management Strategies in Smart Cities

Project Overview: 
This project aims to develop a web-based platform that facilitates the buying and selling of recyclable waste to minimize waste and promote sustainability in smart cities. The platform connects buyers and sellers of recyclable materials, ensuring that reusable waste does not go unused by enabling efficient discovery, classification, and exchange of waste materials through AI-driven features.

User Roles & Authentication

The platform will support two distinct user roles:
Sellers – users who list recyclable waste for sale
Buyers – users who purchase recyclable waste
Both buyers and sellers must have separate login accounts.

Login and registration details must include:
Username
Phone number
Email ID
Password

Each user must have access to a personal dashboard showing:
Complete buying/selling history
Current listings or purchase request
Waste Listing, Images & Categories

Sellers can list recyclable waste under multiple categories, such as:
Glass bottles
Plastic bottles
Wood
Rubber
Other recyclable materials (scalable and extendable)

Each waste listing created by a seller must include:
Waste title
Waste category
Description of the waste
Quantity available
Expected price (per kg or per unit)
Seller location
Seller phone number
Images of the waste material (mandatory, for buyer reference before purchasing)

Buyer Functionality & AI-Based Waste Identification

Buyers can:
Browse the list of available recyclable waste
Specify the quantity needed
View waste details, images, price, and seller contact information
If a buyer is unable to identify or classify the waste type, the system should allow the buyer to:
Upload an image of the waste

The website should use AI-based image classification to:
Identify and classify the waste material
Automatically suggest the correct waste category
Display a list of matching or relevant waste listings available on the platform
Search, Filter & Easy Access

The platform must include a filter and search feature for easy navigation, allowing users to filter waste listings by:
Category
Quantity
Price range
Distance (within a selected radius)
Location, Maps & Navigation

The system must display both:
Buyer location
Seller location
Along with location details, the phone numbers of both buyers and sellers should be visible for direct communication.

An integrated map feature must:
Show the exact route from buyer to seller
Display distance and estimated travel time
Be fully visible and interactive
AI & Dataset Requirements
The project includes AI-based waste management strategies.

A trained dataset must be used for waste identification and classification:

Minimum dataset size: 2000 records
Preferred source: Kaggle

The dataset should support:
Waste image classification
Category prediction
Recommendation or matching logic
Key Deliverables Required from Vendor
Fully functional web application
Live website URL
AI-trained dataset (minimum 2000 entries, preferably from Kaggle)
AI-based waste image classification feature
Image upload support for buyers and sellers
Integrated and visible maps with routing, distance, and time
Complete buyer–seller workflow with login, history, and filters


NOTE - don't use node.js and react.js use AI tools in easy way


Thank you for the detailed answers! Let me clarify a few important points:

## About Technology
**Important clarification:** Lovable is built on React - this is the underlying technology we use and cannot change. However, the good news is that **you won't need to write any code yourself**! Lovable handles all the technical implementation automatically. When I mention "React," it's just what runs behind the scenes - you interact through natural language, not code.

## About AI & Dataset
For the AI waste classification, I have a **much better approach** than training a custom model with a Kaggle dataset:

**Lovable AI with Google Gemini Vision** can:
- Instantly classify waste images without needing a training dataset
- Identify materials (plastic, glass, metal, wood, rubber, etc.) from photos
- Work immediately without any machine learning setup
- Be more accurate than a small 2000-record custom dataset

The Gemini model has been trained on billions of images and can recognize waste materials out of the box. This saves you:
- Time (no dataset preparation)
- Cost (no ML infrastructure)
- Complexity (no model training)

Would you like me to proceed with this AI approach? It's significantly more practical and powerful than training a custom model.

Now let me create a comprehensive plan:

# 🌱 RecycleConnect - AI-Powered Waste Marketplace

## Overview
A web platform connecting buyers and sellers of recyclable waste materials, featuring AI-powered waste identification and interactive mapping for smart city sustainability.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication

### User Registration & Login System
- **Two user types**: Buyers and Sellers with separate registration flows
- **Registration fields**: Username, Email, Phone Number, Password
- **Secure authentication** with email verification
- **Password reset functionality**

### User Dashboards
- **Seller Dashboard**: View all listed items, sales history, edit/delete listings
- **Buyer Dashboard**: Purchase history, saved items, recent searches
